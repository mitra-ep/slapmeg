Title: Pathway testing for Longitudinal Omics
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Mitra Ebrahimpoor
Maintainer: Mitra Ebrahimpoor <m.ebrahimpoor@lumc.nl>
Description: SLaPMEG fits a shared latent process mixed model over the longitudinal measures of omics in a pathway. The shared model allows deviation from this shared process at subject level (a random intercept, slope, or both per subject) and also at omic level (a random effect per omic). These random effects summarize the longitudinal trend of the observation which can be used to test for group diferences using Globaltest. If the pathway is large or the shared effect is small, it is possible to fit a series of pairwise methods and estimate the shared random effects based on them.
